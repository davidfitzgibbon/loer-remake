	<p>Architecture can transcend the everyday. In the pattern of a tree we see the potential of a concrete structure. Loer Architecten designs authoritative architecture with a metaphorical character. We embrace the whole process from design to execution to guarantee quality. Our clientsâ€™ desires are unified with the craftsmanship of our makers. We are supported by an inspiring network of artists, contractors and furniture makers who stand behind us. Together we build future-proof architecture that appeals to the imagination.</p>

	<p>Loer Architecten was founded by Frank Loer and is based in Rotterdam. With a passionate team of architects he designs residential buildings, offices, houses and public projects. The office is actively working on the energy transition and draws all projects in BIM (3D). Frank started his career at the renowned office of Herzog & de Meuron in Switzerland. Next to that he worked on award-winning projects at Powerhouse Company. Frank works with builders such as 13 Speciaal and teaches at the Rotterdam Academy of Architecture Rotterdam.</p>
